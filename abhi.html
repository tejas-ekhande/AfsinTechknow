            Ansys fluid dynamics solutions are fully integrated into the Ansys
            Workbench platform. This environment delivers high productivity and
            easy-to-use workflows. Workbench integrates all your fluid workflow
            needs (pre-processing, simulation, and post-processing) as well as
            multiphysics functionality (fluid–structure interaction (FSI),
            electromagnetic/fluid coupling, etc.) into one easy to use
            interface. Additionally, via Workbench, you gain the ability to
            perform automated design optimization studies.
